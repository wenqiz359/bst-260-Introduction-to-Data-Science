After finishing the homework, you are to turn in all the code.

1. Start an RStudio project. Recommended name: `pset-01-rmarkdown`. Start a Quarto document called `beginning.qmd`.

2. Create a directory called `img` and save a screen shot of your RStudio session for the project. Include your screenshot in the Quarto document.

```         
mkdir img
mv ~/Desktop/screen_shot_RStudio_session.png img/screen_shot_RStudio_session.png
```

![RStudio Screenshot](img/screen_shot_RStudio_session.png)

3. Next, in your Quarto document, define variables $a=1, b=-1, c=-2$ and print out the solutions to $f(x) = ax^2+bx+c=0$. Do not report complex solutions, only real numbers. 

    ```{r}
    a <- 1
    b <- -1
    c <- -2

    solve_quadratic <- function(a, b, c) {
      discriminant <- b^2 - 4*a*c
      
      if (discriminant < 0) {
        return("No real solutions")
      } else if (discriminant == 0) {
        solution <- -b / (2*a)
        return(paste("One solution:", solution))
      } else {
        sol1 <- (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
        sol2 <- (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
        return(paste("Two solutions:", sol1,',', sol2))
      }
    }

    solve_quadratic(a, b, c)
    ```
    

4. Include a graph of $f(x)$ versus $x$ for $x \in (-5,5)$.

```{r}
x <- seq(-5, 5, length = 100) 
f_x <- a*x^2+b*x+c 
plot(x,f_x,type='l')
```

5. Create a directory called `docs`. Use the command `quarto render` to create a PDF and save it to the `docs` directory. Show us the command you typed:

```         
mkdir docs
install.packages("tinytex")
quarto render beginning.qmd --to pdf --output-dir docs
```


6. Use Unix to create a directory called `data` in the project home directory. Include the Unix command you used to create the directory.

```         
mkdir data
```


7. Use a terminal-based text editor to create a file `coefs.txt` in the `data` directory and save three coefficients, `1 -1 -2` for example. Show us the Unix commands you used to achieve this:

```         
nano data/coefs.txt 
```

8. Make a directory called `code`. Use Unix to copy the file `beginning.qmd` to a file called `quadratic.qmd` in the code directory. Show us the Unix commands you used.


```         
mkdir data
cp beginning.qmd code/quadratic.qmd
```
9. Edit the `quadratic.qmd` file to read in `a`, `b`, and `c` from the file `coefs.txt`. Make sure to use a relative path when reading the file. As before, print out the solutions to $f(x) = ax^2+bx+c=0$. Do not report complex solutions, only real numbers. 


    ```{r}

    coefs <- coefs <- scan("../data/coefs.txt", what = numeric())
    a <- coefs[1]
    b <- coefs[2]
    c <- coefs[3]

    solve_quadratic <- function(a, b, c) {
      discriminant <- b^2 - 4*a*c
      
      if (discriminant < 0) {
        return("No real solutions")
      } else if (discriminant == 0) {
        solution <- -b / (2*a)
        return(paste("One solution:", solution))
      } else {
        sol1 <- (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
        sol2 <- (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
        return(paste("Two solutions:", sol1,',', sol2))
      }
    }

    solve_quadratic(a, b, c)
    ```


10. Change the path of the file you are reading to the full path you get when you type `file.path(getwd(), "data/coefs.txt")`. Confirm that the file still renders. Then move the entire `pset-01-rmarkdown` project to a directory called `RtmpyDknq4`.  Does the file render? Change the path back to a relative path and see if it renders.


I changed the path to `coefs <- scan(file.path(getwd(), "../data/coefs.txt"), what = numeric())`, the files renders. (I added `../` before data. Because the file is in "code" file, so`getwd()` will position in "code" file, while "coefs.txt" is in "data" file, so I need to use `../`to get back to previous directory).

When moving the entire `pset-01-rmarkdown` to a directory called `RtmpyDknq4`, the file does not render (the original path is`/Users/zengwenqi/Desktop/Harvard/Fall_2024/BST_260/2024pset-01-wenqiz359/pset-01-rmarkdown/data/coefs.txt,` but after adding a new directory called RtmpyDknq4, it doesn't work because the original path missed a directory.

Changing the path back to a relative path(`"../data/coefs.txt"`) does render.
